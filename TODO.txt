-we need to implement JSON reading so that, when the scene is changed inside the editor, it updates the JSON config that 
PeachCore reads from on startup. so that all asset changes and such are reflected appropriately

-The JSON reading capabilities can be repurposesd for REDO/UNDO; AUTOSAVE; EXPOSING VARIABLES FROM SCRIPTS TO
EDITOR.

MAKE SURE: we need the editor colour pallettes to be colour-blind friendly, so we need to pick seperate pallettes that i like
for each kind of colour blindness
(also make a tool for colour blind people to work with visual assets that tries to make things easier)

MAKE SURE: ALL relevant information must be available easily in a nice visual manner that accomodates the hard of hearing
eg. creating tools that visualize where spatial sound is coming from with our OpenAL implementation as a standard option for
users/me to implement in any game made with Peach-E
eg. create tools for developers that are hard of hearing to be able to interact with audio assets in a meaningful way for solo devs
and for teams that have a mix of sensory preception capabilities

---------------------- Fixed -----------------------------------
(-FIX BUG: theres a bug where if u force-quit the current running scene when there isnt a scene running, where it causes the 
first instance of a new scene to insta close, then the 2nd time running it works as expected) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-IMPLEMENT: finalize command queue implementation, where the main thread issues the load commands, and create commands
at the same time, and batches all update + delete commands into a list to send into the queue for that frame.

-IMPLEMENT: voice chat capabilities with our OpenAL implementation that allows for live recording from whatever audio device
that is selected and ALLOWED to play at that time by the end-users(gamers(RISE UP))

-FIX BUG: right now when we try to run the peach engine executable on another machine, it seems like we're missing dll's
like python312.dll, some random vs/vc dll missing; it seems like its dll's that are required to run cpp and python code i think
probably should figure out what needs to be bundled with the engine to actually work on different machines and platforms lmao

-POSSIBLE BUG: CHECK FOR OTHER RUNNING INSTANCES OF PEACH EDITOR THAT MIGHT MISTAKENLY BEEN OPENED
(i definitely didn't just do that with vs2022 >w<) SO THAT POSSIBLE WRITES TO THE SAME FILE AT THE SAME TIMEDONT 
CORRUPT SCENE JSON DATA OOF!
